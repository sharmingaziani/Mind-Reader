# Mind-Reader

Welcome to the Mind Reader Game! 

This fun program will prompt you to think of a number between 1-63 and show a series of cards 
displaying random numbers each time.

Press y or n depending on whether the number you're thinking of is present on the cards.

After a few cards the program will guess the number you were thinking of! 

Have fun playing!
